# Booking App

This is a simple booking app prototype that allows users to book a room for a given date and time.
The project was built for the Limehome Fullstack Developer Challenge

## The Stack

The stack is overkill for this project, but I wanted to showcase my skills with the following technologies, especially since these are the technologies used at Limehome:
* Nx for the monorepo
* Angular for the frontend
* NestJS for the backend
* Prisma as the ORM
